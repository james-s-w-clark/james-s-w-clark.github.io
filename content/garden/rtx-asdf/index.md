I've been using previously used `sdkman` for a few years to manage my JDK & Scala installations. It supports a good amount of tooling, but it's very JVM focused. You may know `nvm` or `n` for managing and switching Node versions, or Volta/fnm for more general Javascript tooling management.

Recently I've been getting into Elixir & Phoenix LiveView, and I came across a similar tool called `asdf`. Actually though, thanks to its "plugins" system and almost 700 plugins, you can install so many different tools. Sounds good to me - I have projects using Python, Elixir, Java/Scala, Node, Terraform, AWS CLI, etc.. With one application, I can have tooling defined locally (per-project) so it's all independent and easy to get the tooling right.

This was working great for Elixir & Erlang, but the ergonomics felt a little off. In order to list versions, you have to first download the plugin. And due to its "shim" mechanism, it adds about 100ms delay to each command that passes through the asdf executable (my ELI5 understanding).

I then came across [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx), a Rust tool inspired by `asdf` that takes a different approach. Here's some features I'm really liking:
- Speed - `rtx` points to tooling versions via the PATH, and updates the PATH when necessary - this keeps interactions fast (it doesn't go through a "shim" unless it has to, unlike `asdf`)
    - Also, apparently `python` called via `rtx` is much more response than `python` with `pyenv`
- Installs - If you have a bunch of microservices on different Node/Java versions, `rtx` reloads the relevant version via the PATH when you switch project in your terminal. You don't need to run commands like `nvm use node 16` - it's automatic. Global installs are supported too.
- Plugins - `asdf`'s amazing plugins are here still, but you don't have to explicltly install them first! 
    - `rtx` does have it's own plugins, but <10 at the time of writing. Re-using asdf's plugins is smart
- Documentation - the CLI & interactions are friendly, and setup is (almost) frictionless
- Configuration - `.rtx.toml` and the CLI interactions with it are easy to use, and really powerful - see below!

# Show me the config

For our documentation website, I suggested we move from install nvm/node/yarn/sbt to just this configuration file (.rtx.toml):

```toml
[tools]
node = "16"
yarn = "1.22.19"
sbt = "1.9.2"
```

and this one-click script (in IntelliJ) to go from 0 to READY:

```shell
curl https://rtx.pub/install.sh | sh # install rtx 
echo 'eval "$(~/bin/rtx activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc # hook rtx into shell
rtx install # install tooling
yarn # install deps 
yarn run # launch dev website
```

That's a nice developer experience. I'm happy to know someone can clone a repo, click a button, grab a drink, and come back to a website!

# CI - does it add value here?

So, `rtx` is pretty cool for local development - but what about CI?

For our main project, we use a JDK, Scala, and Mill. 
There's a few Actions for setup (setup-java, coursier-setup, mill-setup, etc.) - but they usually want a version typing out. This could lead to drift between development and CI, and introduce a bit of toil when somebody finally notices or remembers.

[setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  with:
    distribution: 'openjdk' # See 'Supported distributions' for available options
    java-version: '17'
```

But it'd be nice if we could set up more, with less lines right? See [Coursier's setup-action](https://github.com/coursier/setup-action):

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: coursier/setup-action@v1
    with:
    jvm: adopt:17
    apps: sbtn bloop ammonite
```

Ah, so it seems the versions can't be specified (other than for the jvm).

With the [rtx Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rtx-action), our `.rtx.toml` files can be used - which is accurate, and brief:

```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: jdxcode/rtx-action@v1
```

I ran [this](https://github.com/james-s-w-clark/havvk/blob/master/.github/workflows/rtx-action-check.yml) as a workflow dispatch. The first run took 3m36s (it takes a while locally to install Elixir & Erlang too), but [the second run (started soon after) took only 20 seconds](https://github.com/james-s-w-clark/havvk/actions/runs/5627022179/job/15248908167)! GitHub Actions seems to have nicely cached the worker for my `master` branch (270MB total). Apparently there's a [10GB total limit](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) - though I can't see how long it lasts. That's cool though - our action *just works* in CI, is super clean, and in Public GitHub they help us keep things fast with zero-configuration caches!

# ... but my versions for different tools are scattered around my source!

Let's say you use three tools, which are specified in different files:

- openjdk-17 - in a Dockerfile
- Scala 2.13.xy - in a Dependencies.sc file
- mill - in .mill-version

Fortunately, `rtx` uses the `tera` templating engine so we can grab these dynamically.
These commands are kinda grim (I couldn't use " or '; I found `cut` to be a good command, thanks ChatGPT), but are probably "good enough" to not need updating. The sources they read won't be changing spacing much:

```toml
[tools]
mill = { version = "{{exec(command='echo $(cat .mill-version)')}}" }
java = { version = "{{exec(command='grep -m 1 openjdk docker/Dockerfile | cut -c 12- | tr : -')}}" }
scala = { version = "{{exec(command='grep -m 1 2.13 dependencies/Dependencies.sc | cut -c 33-39')}}" }
```

The secret sauce here is:
- `grep -m 1 <phrase>` returns the first line that matches
- `cut 12-` gives from the 12th char onwards, `cut 33-39` does what you'd think

Yep, it does look dumb, but:
- For Java we just pin to a major version; if we stick to the same vendor, there'll be no issue
- For Mill, it's just a plain cat. Not too bad :)
- For Scala, until there's a migration to Scala 3 then we'll just see 2.13.11 -> 2.13.xy

# Additions & Alternatives

- For `asdf`, there is [lazyasdf](https://github.com/mhanberg/lazyasdf) - it's a TUI for `asdf` (like how k9s is a TUI for k8s)
- An alternative to `asdf`/`rtx` is [aqua](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua), written in Go. The local configuration (like .rtx.toml) is aqua.yaml, and it supports global installs too
    - The [Aqua registry](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/tree/main/pkgs) has gives 1200+ results - but I see nothing for Elixir, Java/JDK/JVM, and the only node result is "kubectl-node-shell"
    - The fzf-esque interactive search for packages with `aqua g` is nice, even if I can't find what I want

# What's bad about rtx (security)?

There's a good [security write-up on the rtx repo](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

As you can see, with Tera templating you can run some arbitrary commands (firstly in PRs/GitHub Actions, then locally if a change is merged). There is a command [rtx trust](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx#rtx-trust-options-config_file), meaning "rtx will parse the file with potentially dangerous
features enabled" - I guess that'd be useful if you clone some OSS repo and don't want the tooling. There's also configuration via environment variables, e.g. [RTX_TRUSTED_CONFIG_PATHS](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx#rtx_trusted_config_paths) that may be useful.

Even tools like [gradlew have risks](https://github.com/james-s-w-clark/dependabot-gradlewrapper-test#what-are-some-problems-with-the-gradle-wrapper) though, and that's massively popular. 

To answer "can/should I use rtx?", at this point you need to do your own homework ;)

# Conclusion

I encourage you to give [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) a try. It'll be my tooling manager of choice for personal projects now, and I'm encourgaging its use at work. So far I'm using it in a backend JVM repo, a yarn/node documentation repo, and an Elixir/Erlang repo.
